# ZephnorDungeonCrawlerVimJam
A game created solo over one week for the 2020 VimJam

If you wish to play the game yourself you can find it here: https://annalog2718.itch.io/zephnor-relic-hunter

This version is the one submitted to the gamejam meaning it is still unfinished.

Even with the premade unity gitignore file this project was too large to submit to github so this is just the Assets file including the scrips file containing all the programming for this game.
